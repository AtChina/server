   TODO Get this code to set can_compute_window_function during preparation,
   not during execution.

   The reason for this is the following:
   Our single scan optimization for window functions without tmp table,
   is valid, if and only if, we only need to perform one sorting operation,
   via filesort. The cases where we need to perform one sorting operation only:

   * A select with only one window function.
   * A select with multiple window functions, but they must have their
     partition and order by clauses compatible. This means that one ordering
     is acceptable for both window functions.

       For example:
       partition by a, b, c; order by d, e    results in sorting by a b c d e.
       partition by a; order by d             results in sorting by a d.

       This kind of sorting is compatible. The less specific partition does
       not care for the order of b and c columns so it is valid if we sort
       by those in case of equality over a.

       partition by a, b; order by d, e      results in sorting by a b d e
       partition by a; order by e            results in sorting by a e

      This sorting is incompatible due to the order by clause. The partition by
      clause is compatible, (partition by a) is a prefix for (partition by a, b)
      However, order by e is not a prefix for order by d, e, thus it is not
      compatible.

    The rule for having compatible sorting is thus:
      Each partition order must contain the other window functions partitions
      prefixes, or be a prefix itself. This must hold true for all partitions.
      Analog for the order by clause.
